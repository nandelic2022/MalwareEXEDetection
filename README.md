ll the best SEs obtained on the balanced dataset variations can be downloaded from GitHub repository: https://github.com/nandelic2022/MalwareEXEDetection.git 
After downloading the file simply download the dataset and use the following procedure to calculate the output or evaluation metric values: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calcualte the output by providing input dataset values, 
    \item use output of each SEs as the input in the Sigmoid function.
    \item After the values for the samples and all SEs are obtained calculate the accuracy score, area under receiver operating characteristics curve, precision score, recall score, and f1-score using functions defined in python scikit-learn library.
\end{enumerate}
